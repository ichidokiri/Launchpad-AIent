# Running Frontend and Backend

## Understanding the Architecture

This project uses Next.js App Router, which means:
1. Frontend and backend are integrated into one Next.js application
2. API routes serve as the backend
3. React components serve as the frontend
4. Everything runs on the same server by default

## Starting the Development Server

```bash
# Install dependencies first (if not done already)
pnpm install

# Start the development server
pnpm dev
